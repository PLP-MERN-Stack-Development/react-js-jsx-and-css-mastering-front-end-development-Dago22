## 🎯 Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

## 🔌 API Integration

The application expects a backend API with the following endpoints:

- `GET /api/students` - Fetch all students
- `POST /api/students` - Create a new student
- `PUT /api/students/:id` - Update a student
- `DELETE /api/students/:id` - Delete a student

Update the API base URL in `src/lib/api.js` to point to your backend server.

## 🎨 Customization

### Tailwind CSS

This project uses Tailwind CSS v4. To customize the styling:
1. Modify the `index.css` file for global styles
2. Use Tailwind utility classes directly in your components
3. Check [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for more options

### React Compiler

The React Compiler is enabled for optimized performance. See the [React Compiler Documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler) for more information.
